# Keyboard Driven Workflow

While browsing the web or editing a text, using your keyboard instead of the mouse is always faster. Almost everyone use Control + C shortcut instead of right clicking and then pressing Copy button via mouse. There are tons of shortcuts like that and i think it’s essential to use them for every computer user.

# WHY

A keyboard driven workflow will make you faster. When you think about opening a program or switching to a browser tab, you will be able to do it instantly, instead of picking up your mouse, visually searching for the thing you will click, moving your cursor on top of it and clicking.

If you use your mouse a lot, it’s inevitable that you will feel some ankle pain. I realized how much frustrating is it after i started using my keyboard more.

When it comes to more heavy usage, like programming, you will not spend your precious brain power in searching stuff with your eyes. You should be able to do something instantly when you think of it. Do you want to open an app? You can bind a shortcut for it and use it from now on. It’s way faster than looking at desktop or taskbar to find where is it. Even if you know where is it, it’s still faster than reaching to your mouse.

# Opening & Closing Apps & Tabs

If you use Windows (i’m not sure if this works on Mac), you can open the apps in the taskbar with the Windows key (“Super” in Linux, ⌘ in Mac). For example if the browser is the first app in taskbar, you can press Windows + 1.

You can use an **App Launcher** like Rofi in linux or Alfred in Mac. Window has many similar apps as well.

To close apps, i binded the Super+Q shortcut. The shortcut in Windows is Alt + F4 but it’s quite hard to reach. I think you should change it. Changing key bindings is easy in Linux and Mac but i guess you have to use a third party app in Windows.

Lastly you can close browser tabs via Control+W and open new ones via Control + T.

# Switching Between Apps & Tabs

You can use Control + Tab and Control + Shift + Tab buttons to move between browser tabs. If you have many tabs open, you may want to use Control + Number shortcuts instead. Control + 4 to move to fourth tab, for example.

To switching between apps you can use Alt + Tab, but it can be frustrating if you have 4 or more windows open. You should use multiple workspaces.

# Workspaces & Tiling Window Managers

I saw the workspace concept in Windows 10 first and i didn’t understand it’s point. Then i moved to Linux and i saw it was implemented way better in some Window Managers. I can’t describe how limiting is it to use a single workspace. It’s like having 10 displays and using only one. Or like having a giant desk and still putting everything on top of each other.

You may consider using a **Tiling Window Manager** if you are able to move to Linux. It makes using multiple workspaces even easier and helpful.

You are doing the job of the window manager if you don’t use a tiling one. A Tiling Window Manager, manages the windows as the name suggest. You don’t have to manage their positions. Dragging a window via mouse or double clicking it’s titlebar to make it fullscreen is unnecessary work, i believe.

# Browsing

I used to use my mouse only for clicking the links in the web. Turns out it was unnecessary as well. You can use the **Vimium** extension in Firefox and click links via keyboard. You press the F key and a random hint (one or two letters) appears next to every link. You press the keys in the hint and click that link. If you are in Linux, i can suggest you to use Qute Browser instead of Firefox but i’m not sure if it’s working well in Mac or Windows.

If you are using Firefox or Google Chrome, when you open a new tab you can start typing instantly. If you want to search for something, you can either open a new tab and search there or press **Control + L to focus on address bar** in your current browser.

# Using The Keyboard Faster

Keyboard is generally faster than mouse but it has some bad practices as well. If you are holding a key for a long time or pressing it tens of times, you may want to try finding a better way. Using **Control + Backspace to delete a word** instead of pressing backspace for ten times is a better practice for example. Or instead of moving your cursor next to a word and delete it, you may use the **Delete key**. It deletes the letter in front of it, or deletes the word if you press Control at the same time.

A keyboard contains tens of letters, i think it’s essential to utilize them instead of using them only for typing letters. It will not only make you faster, it will prevent many frustrations, especially if you are behind a computer most of your time.
