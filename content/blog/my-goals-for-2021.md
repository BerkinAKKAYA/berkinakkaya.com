# My Goals for 2021

# Projects

### 1- Redesign Your Website

I am not planning to completely changed it but portfolios needs an update once in a while.

### 2- Create an LS Alternative in Rust

The “ls” command shipped with Linux is not enough for me. I used to use “tree” command with it. Then i discovered “colorls”. It is so good! I want to make a replica of it in Rust. I prefer binaries instead of Ruby or Python executables and i need practice in Rust.

### 3- Create a Speed Coding video for YouTube

I love watching Speed Coding videos, i might like creating too. I don’t know if i will continue it but i want to try at least making one video. It could be a something like a diary for me, i would look back on how i created which projects. And it would be a great demonstration of my skills in my portfolio.

### 4- Learn Rust

Seeing my favourite apps rewritten in Rust made me quite excited about Rust. I want to learn it deeply this year.

# Health & Lifestyle

### 1- No Added Sugar, More Workout

A new year is impossible without these goals…

### 2- Have No Physical Books

I want to sell & donate all my books and read e-books from now on. Having a library used to motivate me, adding new books to it was pleasing. I was dreaming of how big would it be if i read 100 pages a day etc. Now i have a digital library, i want to grow that list.

### 3- More Intentional Music & Movie Consumption

Listening to music is an important part of my life. I want to intentionally search and find good music in 2021. According to Spotify, i added 218 songs to my playlist this year. Not all of them are new though. I want to keep adding different music to my playlist.

Same goes for movies as well. I watched 86 movies this year (I keep track of them in Trakt.tv). It’s enough but the point is not the countity. I want to watch different movies than i watched so far.

# Linux & My Desired System

My computer is at the center of my life and it reflects my personality best. Currently i am using Arch Linux with i3 Window Manager.

My Current Desktop (See My [Dotfiles on GitHub](https://github.com/BerkinAkkaya/dotfiles))

### 1- Try More Distros (Gentoo, Void, Artix)

I don’t think i will use Artix but i just wonder how Arch looks like without systemd. I am very curious about Void Linux. But i feel like i will be using Gentoo in and after 2021. I haven’t tried it before though.

### 2- Have a Custom Compiled Kernel

I compiled my own kernel in Ubuntu before but i couldn’t play with all of the settings. It will consume quite a bit of time to research the settings and it takes more than 4 hours to compile it in my laptop. I will spend that time someday, but not today.

### 3- Try Different Booting Options

I used nothing else than Grub so far. I tried systemd-boot but i couldn’t make it work. I tried Efistub, followed the instructions on Arch Wiki but i destroyed my boot partition by mistake. My knowledge about booting is extremely limited at this point. I want to try rEFInd, systemd-boot, Efistub and increase my knowledge.
